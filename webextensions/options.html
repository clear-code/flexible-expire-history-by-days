        Differently from the previous version of this add-on, this version cannot disable expiration.
      </p>
      <p>
        Disabling expiration is something to be done with extreme care, since the browser expiration
        algorithm has been built to provide the best performance.<br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold; color: red">Disabling Expiration can cause performance issues</span>, especially in the location bar, and it's normally unnecessary.<br>
        If you really need a slow but infinite history, you can open about:config and create a new integer pref named <i>places.history.expiration.max_pages</i> with a value of <i>999999</i>.<br>
        You can then setup your own expiration limit through this add-on.
